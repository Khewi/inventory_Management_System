# inventory_Management_System

This project utilizes Java and JavaFX to create an inventory management system. Key features of the application include several different screens which facilitate adding, deleting, and modifying parts and products. The project uses observable list arrays to store the application data and displays the inventory information through FXML tableviews. Products have the capability to associate and remove relevant parts for inventory management. The program also features logical error checks that will display as error pop ups and prevent the user from saving incprrect data. 


See below for a project scenario:
You are working for a small manufacturing organization that has outgrown its current inventory system. Members of the organization have been using a spreadsheet program to manually enter inventory additions, deletions, and other data from a paper-based system but would now like you to develop a more sophisticated inventory program.

NOTE: not all files have been included in the repository to run the application, but the files listed are relevant for the key feature of this project.
